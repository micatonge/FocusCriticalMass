# FocusCriticalMass

With unlimited time and and resources at Critical Mass, I would focus on a project in which helped enpower women. I would want to program an app specifically that helped educate women on menstrual health or sex ed. It is important to raise awareness on something that has been socially shamed for years. I would spend my time learning how to use a platform for moible app building & develop the app with an inspiring team! I want to use the power of social media to educate and bring awareness as a whole.
